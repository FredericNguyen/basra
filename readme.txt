Basra in Lebanon
The game is for 2-4 players. (2v2 or 1v1v1v1)
52 card pack is used. The turn to deal rotates.
The dealer deals 6 cards to each player - all at once - and 4 cards face up to the middle of the table. 
The rest of the deck is put to one side to be dealt when the first 6 cards have been played.

The scoring values of the cards are:

3 points for the diamond 10
2 points for the club 2
1 point for each jack
1 point for each ace
3 points for whichever player (or team) takes the majority of the cards (if they have 26 cards each, no one gets these points).

CAPTURE:
Play card: capture matching card or get sum of cards equal to played card.
Q and K can only capture themselves (no sum).
J can capture whole table (no points or basra, only card amount) and itself


The play is begun by the player who received the first cards in the deal. Then the turn to play rotates.
